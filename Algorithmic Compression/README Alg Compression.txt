README FOR ALGORITHMIC COMPRESSION
this folder contains:

compression.py			run with a file input
EnglishSmall.dx1		English dx1 file containing 1000 words
keys					Each word with it's foward and backward intervals
Graphic.pdf				A graph with points representing the left endpoint of each interval for each word

As to what the funny lines mean, it seems to be associated with common affixes. I'm not
really sure my graph is correct, but that is what any intersections and clusters should be.
